# 1.Higher Education System for ICT in Myanmar
Throughout series of reforms in 2010's, Myanmar is making debut again on the global market.
Myanmar is ranked as "the Least Developed Country" by UN.
Especially, Asian leading countries pay attention to this country because of the low-cost business environment and big market there.

Japan, for example, established some of ICT companies for Offshore development in Myanmar. I found a referencial article written by a Japanese ICT management worker.

According to his personal experience, there are just 3 universities of ICT-related field in Myanmar:

UCSY：University of Computer Studies Yangon

UCSM：University of Computer Studies Mandare

UIT     ： University of Information Technology (Yangon)

However, he appreciated UIT as the best because some students used to enter UCSY/UCSM now will be likely to enter UIT.

MIIT, Myanmar Institute of Information Technology, is established as the highest ICT institute in 2015.
So these 4 universities are well-known in the industry.

University of Yangon, the oldest and highest-ranked university in Myanmar also has "Department of Computer Studies," but less function because of historical interruption in under-graduate program of the university. So, as long as needing programmers and engineers for offshore development, University of Computer Studies or University of Information Technology are popular as the best ICT schools there, evaluated by Japanese companies for instance.
