# 1.Higher Education System for ICT in Myanmar
Throughout series of reforms in 2010's, Myanmar is making debut again on the global market.
Myanmar is ranked as "the Least Developed Country" by UN.
Especially, Asian leading countries pay attention to this country because of the low-cost business environment and big market there.

Japan, for example, established some of ICT companies for Offshore development in Myanmar. I found a referencial article written by a Japanese ICT management worker.

According to his personal experience, there are just 3 universities of ICT-related field in Myanmar:

UCSY：University Computer Studies Yangon

UCSM：University Computer Studies Mandare

UIT     ： University of Information Technology (Yangon)

However, he appreciated UIT as the best because some students used to enter UCSY/UCSM now will be likely to enter UIT.

MIIT, Myanmar Institute of Information Technology, is established as the highest ICT institute in 2015.
So these 4 universities are well-known in the industry.
